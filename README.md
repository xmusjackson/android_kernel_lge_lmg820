#Stock+ 4.14.117 for LG G8 US (TMO)
This will be the source for my LG G8 kernel. For now it is not working.
This readme will be updated when I finish making changes and it does work.

This is the kernel source for the LG G8 T-Mobile (LM-G820TM) downloaded
from opensource.lge.com, specifically for the 20J build. Compatibility with
devices outside of the Tmo LG G8 and 20J build are to be determined.
